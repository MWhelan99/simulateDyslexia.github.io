        <h2 class="explained"> Welcome to DyslexiaSimulator</h2>
        <p class="explains">
          My name is Meadbh Whelan. I am a final year Film and Digital Media student.
          For my Final Year project I wanted to create a site that visually displays what dyslexia can look like.
          While researching for this project I realised that a lack in trying to simulate dyslexia.
          Dyslexia is different for each person who has it and I find it can be often that it is over looked and reduced down to just having an issue with reading.
          Dyslexia comes in many different forms people with dyslexia can struggle with reading anf writing which is how people commonly understand dyslexia.
          They can also struggle with Memory, Vision, Hearing and Nero Delevopment (Organising, Slow Process etc). 
          Dyslexia is a spectrum and everyone is different. For my project I wanted to create two different people with dyslexia.
          While they both have dyslexia they have different forms of it. The user can see just two examples of the different types. 
<br><br>
          The aim of this site is to help users understand that dyslexia is not a one size fits all learning disability. I decided to focus on reading and the way text and letters are seen because it is the most common type of dyslexia people think of. 
          

          <br>
         The design of the site is a mixture of my favourite type of design which is dark, dystopian and glitchy with a site that's child freindly. 
         <br>

         I hope you enjoy the site and get a better understanding of dyslexia.
